# Mission

---

The mission of the Bolivian Virtual Observatory (BVO) is to democratize access to astronomical and astrophotographic research in Bolivia through free workshops and a network of remote telescopes in professional observatories. We seek to overcome the barriers of accessibility to high-quality telescopes and the high costs of acquiring scientific data, providing an accessible platform for students, educators and amateur astronomers. Our goal is to train participants in astronomical observation and data processing, encouraging the development of meaningful research and the advancement of astronomy education.
