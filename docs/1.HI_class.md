# A. HI Classification - CNN and Machine Learning

> **Note:** We present a repository for an HI Profile Classification project developed by *G. Jaimes* (gjaimes@iaa.es) for the AMIGA (*Analysis of the Interstellar Medium in Isolated GAlaxies*) research group at the *Institute of Astrophysics of Andalus√≠a* (IAA).

Our project page is dedicated to the classification of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) spectral profiles using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Our research focuses on harnessing the potential of ML to analyze and classify HI profiles, which are crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies. This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other ML algorithms to large radio astronomy datasets, with the aim of enhancing the quality and efficiency of scientific analysis in the field.

# 1. Data Preprocessing
The foundation of the project lies in the *meticulous preprocessing* of HI spectral data. We utilized the **Busyfit** package for fitting HI spectrum profiles, a critical step in ensuring accurate data representation. The profiles were further refined through iterative fitting using polynomial, Gaussian, and double-Lorentzian models. This preprocessing stage is vital for preparing the data for subsequent analysis and classification, ensuring that the input to our models is as precise and informative as possible.
