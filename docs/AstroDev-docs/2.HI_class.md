# 2. Profile Fitting using BusyfitÔÉÅ
In addition to preprocessing, profile fitting plays a crucial role in our framework. The Busyfit package enabled us to accurately fit HI spectral profiles, providing a solid base for further analysis. By fitting the profiles with various models, we generated a secondary dataset that was essential for refining our classification algorithms. This stage ensured that our models were not only trained on high-quality data but also capable of generalizing well to new, unseen profiles.
