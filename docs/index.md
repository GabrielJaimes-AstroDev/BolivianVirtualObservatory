## Welcome to the Bolivian Virtual Observatory

---

<p style="text-align: justify;">
    <em>The Bolivian Virtual Observatory (BVO) project seeks the implementation of free workshops on the study of transient astronomical phenomena and astrophotography processing through a campaign of astronomical observations planned by a team from Bolivia. In order to overcome accessibility barriers to professional telescopes, high costs for the acquisition of data with scientific value and the need for specialized training, this significant challenge is addressed for the development of astronomical research in Bolivia. 
    <br>The project is led by Principal Investigator MSc. Gabriel Jaimes and a team of Bolivian volunteers consisting of researchers, students, and professionals. It aims to conduct scientific research using the remote telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), housed in professional observatories at prime locations with ideal sky conditions, including Hawaii, the Canary Islands, Chile, Australia, and South Africa. The BVO project provides students and educators with dedicated training in astronomical observation programs at no cost for participation.
