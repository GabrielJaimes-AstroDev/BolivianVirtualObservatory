# 3. HI Profiles Classification using Shapelets and CNN
Our approach to HI profile classification integrates unsupervised ML techniques with CNNs. We implemented various clustering algorithms such as K-means, spectral clustering, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering to detect and extract features from the profiles. These features serve as the foundation for our classification models, which include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers. To further optimize classification performance, we explored different CNN configurations, rigorously evaluating their impact on accuracy and reliability.
