*"The first scientific images of 2024sbx, a Type II Supernova, were obtained by the Bolivian Virtual Observatory. Three images taken through Sloan photometric filters (r, g, i) are shown, along with a fourth from the DSS catalog. In the center, the Supernova is observed with an increase in brightness, and above it, its associated galaxy".*

*"M16, known as the Eagle Nebula, is a vast cloud of gas (mainly hydrogen) and dust located in the constellation Serpens, specifically in the region of Serpens Cauda (the tail of the Serpent), approximately 7,000 light-years away. Its diameter is estimated to be between 70 and 80 light-years. Additionally, it has an associated open cluster.".*
